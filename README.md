# Programming Practice

Practice and test programming problems.

It's recommended to come up with the algorithm and write the code out by hand before implementing the solution.

## Instructions

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org)
2. `npm install`
3. `npm test`

## Scripts

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run cover
```

There is also a test watch script.

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Adding new problems

Test script runs every .spec.js file in the project. Add new problems by creating a .spec.js along with any file or folder structure that clearly encapsulates the problem.
